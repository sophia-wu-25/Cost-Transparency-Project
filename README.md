# Cost-Transparency-Project
Project to quantify "hidden" costs of private education.

## Team:
Back-End: Sophia Wu and Amanda Harmon

Front-End: Andy Wang, Tiger Li, and Shane Patel

Client/Director: Peter Park

## Purpose:
Creates a system to track 'hidden' expenses of private education. On top of the 'sticker price' of tuition and board, it's important for students and their families to understand the 'hidden' expenses such as those for textbooks, sports equipment, art supplies, and field trips. 

The back-end of this project maintains a SQL database hosted on the school server, which can be edited through a Google sheet by teachers, athletic directors, and admin to keep track of costs. **Uses Python for web-scraping texbook prices and JavaScript for athletics data

These costs are then consolidated on the front-end in a website that serves as a cost calculator and allows students to consider all costs before enrolling in a class or choosing an after school activity.
